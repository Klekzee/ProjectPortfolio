Web scraper using Python and Beautiful Soup 4.

Disclaimer: This was my very first project so the code can be a little messy but I added some comments to hopefully convey my thinking/coding process.


I made this to gather more updated information on the Philippine (PH) housing market since the ones I found on Kaggle were either outdated or have missing information that I need.
