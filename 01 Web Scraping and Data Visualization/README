This contains the Philippines Housing Market Dataset scraped from Lamudi (https://www.lamudi.com.ph).

Web scraping was done using Python and Beautiful Soup 4 and Geocoding was done by GeoPy.
Data cleaning is done with excel.

Disclaimer: This is my very first project so the code can be a little messy but I added some comments to hopefully convey my thinking/coding process.

I made this to gather more updated information on the Philippines (PH) housing market since the ones I found on Kaggle were either outdated or have missing information that I need.
